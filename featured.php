<h2>Featured Words (Japan)</h2>

<p>
    Japanese has a rich, vibrant culture - and a wealth of words that are hard to translate directly into English.  
</p>
<p>
    In Japan, there is a strong focus on group harmony, respect, and unspoken understanding. These cultural values influence the way people speak and the kinds of words they use to describe everyday experiences.
</p>
<p>
    As a result, Japanese has developed words that express ideas and feelings that don't exist in the same way in English. These untranslatable words reflect the unique way people in Japan relate to each other and to the world around them.
